==== v0.3.0 (September 1, 2011) ====

---- Features ----

* iSynaptic.Commons.Data assembly is now collapsed into iSynaptic.Commons
  assembly.

* Added initial implementation of the Outcome<T> monad.

* Created KeyedReaderWriter and SymbolDictionary classes.

* All Maybe<T> operators have undergone performance optimizations.

* Added Join and Unwrap Maybe<T> operators.

* Added ToMaybe operator that can also do casting.

* Added Squash operator to squash IEnumerable<Maybe<T>> into a IEnumerabe<T>
  stream.

* Added new ISymbol and ISymbol<T> interfaces to represent the concept of
  symbols that other languages have.

* Added Maybe.If overloads that emit the elseValue and use Maybe<T>.NoValue
  if the predicate evaluates to false.

* Added Maybe.ToEnumerable overloads that allow multiple Maybe<T> values to
  be coerced into an IEnumerable<T>.

* When inheriting from ExodataDeclaration, you can now completely override
  how the declaration resolves data.

* Exodata now supports the ability to non-deterministically retrieve data
  (via Maybe<T>).

* ExodataBindings can now carry a name; ambiguous Exodata resolution yields
  a custom exception that provides a list of the ambiguous ExodataBindings.

* ExodataSurrogate binding sources now allows multiple surrogates for the same
  subject type and with arbitrary surrogate inheritance hierarchies.

* ExodataRequest is now exposed to help in the creation of Exodata requests.

---- Breaking Changes ----

* Renamed interfaces and classes suffixed with Qualifier to Indexer

* All Maybe.Extract implementations have been renamed to ValueOrDefault. This 
  more accurately communicates the function's behavior.  This is similar to
  IEnumerable<T>'s FirstOrDefault methods.
 
* A new method, named Extract has been implemented that will throw an exception
  if no value is available.  This is similar to IEnumerable<T>'s First method.

* Maybe<T> no longer has an implicit cast from T to Maybe<T> - this eliminates
  a number of surprises in connection with type inference.

* Maybe<T> operators Cast, OfType, and AsMaybe now treat null input as NoValue

* Maybe<T> operator Cast no longer throws an exception, it just yields one a
  Maybe<T> that contains an InvalidCastException.

* Maybe<T>.Express has been moved to the static Maybe class as an extension
  method.  There are no more Maybe<T> operators directly implemented in the
  Maybe<T> structure.

* Moved EnumerableExtensions to iSynaptic.Commons.Linq namespace.

* Renamed EnumerableExtensions.Flatten to Recurse to better reflect what the
  method does.

* Collapsed common ExodataDeclaration types in ExodataDeclarations namespace
  into root namespace.

* IExodataAttribute now has only one member: TryResolve.

* IExodataBinding now only has one member: TryResolve.

* IExodataRequest now exposes a Maybe<T> for the Context and Subject to enable
  easy usage of Maybe operators.

* The fluent interface used to define Exodata bindings now allows you to return
  a Maybe<T> to represent the inability to resolve data.

* Exodata resolution no-longer depends directly on ExodataDeclarations, it now
  depends on Symbols.

* Dropped direct support for LazyExodata - this behavior can be achieved easily
  without direct support by Exodata.

* Removed Specification pattern implementation.

* Deleted IDependencyDeclaration - replaced with ISymbol.

* Removed numerous Action<...>, Func<...>, and Predicate<...> extension methods.


==== v0.2.1 (June 29, 2011) ====

---- Breaking Changes ----

* Removed the Maybe.Or operator that takes in just a T.  This overload makes
  it difficult for the C# compiler to do type inference.



==== v0.2.0 (June 29, 2011) ====

* This release reflects some collaboration with Brian Beckman (Microsoft), and
  research into CoMonads, and as a result Maybe<T> and some supporting
  operators have gone through significant changes.
  
* The names of many of the Maybe<T> operators have been changed.  See breaking
  changes below.

* Removed the internal MaybeResult structure that Maybe<T> used to represent
  the evaluated result of Maybe<T>.  Since Maybe<T> had a superset of
  MaybeResult's public interface, Maybe<T> was refactored to directly store the
  data that MaybeResult originally stored.

---- Features ----

* Express method on Maybe<T> allows the development of Maybe<T> operators that
  need full visibility into the Maybe<T> structure.  Express adds lazy
  evaluation semantics and memoization.  All other Maybe<T> operators are
  written either directly or indirectly using Express.

* Maybe<T> now has a constructor that takes a Func<Maybe<T>> to allow the
  function to be lazily evaluated and viewed as a Maybe<T>.

* Maybe<T> now has a number of operators named ThrowOn that allow you to define
  conditions where an exception should be thrown upon evaluation of the
  Maybe<T>.

* Maybe<T> now has a GetHashCode implementation that takes in an 
  IEqualityComparere<T> implementation.  This brings parity with the Equals
  methods available on Maybe<T>.

* Support for C# comprehension syntax is now supported for Maybe<T>.  Thanks to
  Brian Beckman for the reference implementation of SelectMany.
  
  Design Note: SelectMany is the method that the C# compiler looks for when
  translating LINQ comprehension syntax into method invocations.  Although,
  LINQ comprehension syntax can be used when many different Monads, the
  decision to call the monadic "bind" operation "SelectMany" semantically
  couples C#'s support of Monads to the List Monad. In other words, "Many" in 
  "SelectMany" assumes that there are many values that could be selected.  In
  the case of Maybe<T>, there is at most one value to be selected, so 
  "SelectMany" does not make sense semantically.  However, in order to support
  C# comprehension syntax, the method name must be named SelectMany.  
  Maybe<T>'s SelectMany method has the EditorBrowseableAttribute applied to it
  so that SelectMany is not visible in IntelliSense (under standard Visual
  Studio IDE configurations).  SelectMany and SelectMaybe are just aliases for
  the Bind operator.

* Created CompositeDisposable class to treat many disposables as one. The
  DisposableContext has now been refactored to make use of this class.

  Design Note: CompositeDisposable may eventually be collapsed back into
  DisposableContext once DisposableContext (and all Scope<T> implementations)
  can be created as a explicit context and not only a thread or app-domain
  static context.

* Created OrderByPriorities operator on IEnumerable<T>. You can provide one or
  more predicates that give higher sort priority to the items where the
  predicate returns true.

* Added ToMaybe() operator that enables easy creation of Maybe<T> from
  arbitrary values.  This is an alias to the Maybe.Return operator, while
  allowing it to be used as an extension method.

* Added If extension method to Maybe<T> that allows a new Maybe<T> to be
  created based on a predicate.

* Added a Finally extension method to Maybe<T> to allow cleanup logic to be
  executed after the Maybe<T> has been evaluated.

* Added a ToEnumerable operator to Maybe<T> to allow transition from the Maybe
  monad to the List monad.  If the Maybe<T> has a value, the enumerable will
  yield only that one value.  If the Maybe<T> has no value, the enumerable will
  yield an empty stream.  If the Maybe<T> contains an exception, the enumerable
  will throw the exception upon every enumeration.

* Added AsMaybe operators that treat IMaybe<T> and IMaybe implementations as
  Maybe<T> or Maybe<object> respectively and allow use of operators that rely
  on Maybe<T>.

  Design Note: The reason for implementing the Maybe Monad as a structure was
  to keep the core type, Maybe<T>, very lightweight.  Storing simple values
  such as integers in a Maybe<T> incurs very little overhead
  (e.g Maybe.Return(42)). As such, all of the operators are implemented using
  the Maybe<T> structure, and not the IMaybe<T> or IMaybe interface.  The
  interfaces are provided to support co-variant and non-generic scenarios.

* Cloneable<T> no longer prevents cloning of types that have IntPtr and UIntPtr
  fields.  In the future, Cloneable<T> may no longer prevent cloning objects
  that have delegates as fields.

* EnlistmentScope now has virtual members to enable alternative enlisted item
  management.

* Added Flip and Curry extension methods to Func<...> and Action.

* Input validation was added to numerous methods throughout the library.

---- Breaking Changes ----

* Exceptions thrown when evaluating the result of a Maybe<T> will now escape
  the Maybe<T>.  This brings parity between Maybe<T> and IEnumerable<T>'s
  treatment of exceptions.  A Catch() operator has been implemented which will
  catch exceptions thrown from up-stream Maybe<T> operators.

* The Unsafe method on Maybe<T> has been removed. This allowed the construction
  of Maybe<T> that did not have exception protection.  Since exception 
  protection no longer implemented, this method was removed.  Additionally,
  other methods used Unsafe because they wanted access to the Exception, 
  HasValue, and Value properties to implement their logic. The Express method
  now provides this capability.

* The Select operation that takes a Func<T, Maybe<TResult>> has been renamed to
  SelectMaybe, as it was always an alias of Bind.

* Maybe.Return has been renamed to Maybe.Extract.  Since CoMonads have a
  "extract" operation that take a CoMonad and extracts a T, it made more sense
  to call this operation Extract.

* Maybe.Value has been renamed to Maybe.Return.  Since Monads have a "return"
  operation that takes a T and puts it into the Monad, it made more sense to
  call this operation Return.

* Maybe.When overloads have been simplified by removing the ones that take
  Func<T, Maybe<T>> as an argument.  Maybe.Defer can be used in with Maybe.When
  to achieve the same behavior.

* Maybe.ThrowOn now takes one less argument.  It now takes a function that
  optionally returns an exception.  If it returns an exception, the exception
  is thrown.  If it returns null, nothing occurs.

* The Maybe.Using operator that takes an IDisposable as its first argument has
  been removed.  Using Return and the new Finally method can be used to achieve
  the same behavior.

* Maybe<T>.Bind and Maybe<T>.Select have been moved to the Maybe class and
  turned into extension methods.  This allows other extension methods to be
  authored that deals with Maybe<T> when T is a more specific or constrained
  type.

* Many of the OnException overloads have been renamed to Suppress.  This brings
  parity with the other OnXXX methods that only have side-effects and do not
  change the resulting value.

* BaseReadOnlyDictionary no longer allows you to override the IsReadOnly
  property. This should always return true, and this prevents derived
  implementations from breaking this invariant.

* Renamed Zip to ZipAll to prevent naming conflict with existing IEnumerable<T>
  extension methods.

* Removed ThrowPreservingCallStack Exception extension method, since the 
  implementation doesn't truly preserve the call stack.  Replaced with the
  ThrowAsInnerExceptionIfNeeded extension method, which if used against an
  exception that has already been thrown once, clones the exception, and sets
  the clone's InnerException to the original before throwing the clone. This
  allows original call stack to be preserved verbatim (albeit in the
  InnerException), while not changing the exception type or message that is
  being "re-thrown".

* Renamed extension method SynchronizeOn to Synchronize for both Func<...> and 
  Maybe<T> so that it is not confused which an operation that forces execution
  to happen on a different thread (similar to how Task<TResult> and
  IObservable<T> schedulers do).
