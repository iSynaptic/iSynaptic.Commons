- Refactor SimpleScanner to a class that inherits from abstract TextScanner<T>, where T is the Token type
	* Use character map tool to identify common character tokens
- Add IDeferable<T> interface and basic Deferable<T> implementation (if TPL suggestion is implemented, this will be removed)
- Create generic Visitor implementation (similar to one used in RegularExpressionPipeline)...
- Integrate iSynaptic.SolutionBuild...
- Add RelativePath extension methods to FileSystemInfo and IEnumerable<FileSystemInfo>...
- Add overridable OnEnlistment() method to UnitOfWork<U, T> class...
- Investigate how Monads could be encorporated in "PipelineEnumerable" concept
    * Perhaps change so that it is strictly functional composition (i.e. not require interface)
